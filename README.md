# Pipelined RV32 SoC

A synthesizable 32-bit RISC-V processor with a five-stage pipeline, dynamic
branch prediction, private L1 instruction/data caches, and independent AXI4
memory buses.

This repository contains the CPU core, standalone cache and AXI4 verification
environments, the integrated processor, architecture documents, and an
automated Vivado regression flow.

## Current status

- ISA: RV32I and RV32M
- Pipeline: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB
- Hazard handling: forwarding, load-use stall, pipeline flush
- Branch prediction: BHT with 2-bit counters and a BTB
- L1 caches: two-way set associative, 64 sets, eight 32-bit words per line
- D-Cache policy: write-through, no-write-allocate
- Memory interface: full AXI4 with 4-bit transaction IDs
- Cache refill: eight-beat incrementing AXI4 bursts
- Verification: all 12 processor regression cases pass
- Synthesis: Vivado 2025.1, zero errors and zero critical warnings

```

The instruction and data paths use independent AXI4 managers. One-entry
response buffers at the CPU/cache boundary preserve a response until the
pipeline can accept the instruction-side and data-side results atomically.
This prevents response loss and forward-progress problems during simultaneous
cache activity.

Architecture diagrams and design notes are available in [`SPEC/`](SPEC/).

## Verification

### Requirements

- Windows
- Python 3
- Xilinx Vivado 2025.1

The checked-in Vivado batch flow currently uses the local Windows installation
at `C:\Xilinx\2025.1\Vivado`. If the repository is cloned elsewhere, update the
absolute processor paths in `RISC-V-Processor/Script.tcl`,
`RISC-V-Processor/RTL/I_BRAM.sv`, and
`RISC-V-Processor/RTL/RISCV_PROCESSOR_tb.v`.

### Run the processor regression

```powershell
cd RISC-V-Processor
python Verify_Script.py
```

Select one test case or enter `all` to execute the complete 12-case regression.
For every case, the script:

1. Converts the assembly-style pattern into instruction bytes.
2. Generates Vivado `.coe` and synthesizable 32-bit `.mem` images.
3. Runs the Python golden model.
4. Creates a fresh Vivado behavioral simulation snapshot.
5. Compares all 32 GPR values and 32 bytes of data memory.
6. Fails the run if either AXI4 SVA checker reports a protocol violation.

The final integrated version passes all 12 existing cases without modifying
their test programs.

### AXI4 protocol checking

[`CACHE/AXI4/CHECKER.sv`](CACHE/AXI4/CHECKER.sv) contains SystemVerilog
Assertions for the AXI4 channels, including payload stability under backpressure,
burst attributes, response ordering, IDs, `RLAST`/`WLAST`, and reset behavior.
The processor testbench instantiates one checker for the instruction bus and
one for the data bus.

## Synthesis result

The integrated `RISCV_PROCESSOR` top was synthesized for
`xc7z010clg400-1` with Vivado 2025.1:

- 0 synthesis errors
- 0 critical warnings
- instruction `.mem` initialization successfully read by synthesis

The current constraint requests a 250 MHz clock. Passing synthesis does not by
itself guarantee post-place-and-route timing closure; implementation and timing
sign-off remain separate steps.
